## Legal Framework

### GDPR Compliance

Our system is designed to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and includes:

- **Lawful basis for processing**: Clear identification of legal grounds for data processing
- **Consent management**: Granular consent mechanisms where required
- **Data minimization**: Processing only necessary data
- **Purpose limitation**: Using data only for specified purposes
- **Accuracy**: Maintaining accurate and up-to-date data
- **Storage limitation**: Implementing data retention policies
- **Security**: Ensuring appropriate technical and organizational measures
- **Accountability**: Demonstrating compliance through documentation

### Additional Compliance

- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act) - US users
- **PIPEDA** (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) - Canadian users
- **Data Protection Act 2018** - UK users

## Data Protection Principles

### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency

**Implementation:**
- Clear privacy notices explaining data processing
- Transparent consent mechanisms
- Regular privacy impact assessments
- User-friendly language in all communications

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Consent recording with full transparency
await gdpr_manager.record_consent(
    user_id=user.id,
    purpose=DataProcessingPurpose.CONTRACT,
    consent_given=True,
    consent_text="I agree to processing my data for memory storage services",
    ip_address=request.client.host
)
```

### 2. Purpose Limitation
